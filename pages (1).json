      "content": "<p>Japan’s journey into the Internet realm began in the early 1980s. According to <strong>Nippon.com</strong>, “the term ‘Internet’ had yet to be coined, but the concept was already forming in the late 1970s” [2]. Much of the progress in these formative years can be attributed to Professor <strong>Jun Murai</strong>, often referred to as “the father of the Internet in Japan,” who founded the <strong>WIDE (Widely Integrated Distributed Environment)</strong> project [2].</p><p>This project connected various research institutions and laid the foundation for the country’s network infrastructure. By the late 1980s, Japanese researchers successfully established data-exchange channels with the University of Hawaii, creating stronger ties to international networks [2][3].</p><p>Commercial Internet services began appearing around <strong>1992</strong>, signaling a new phase of widespread adoption beyond academic circles [2]. As usage expanded rapidly in the mid-1990s, Japan saw an increasing number of businesses and private citizens coming online [1].</p>"

      "content": "<p>From the introduction of commercial Internet services in the early 1990s to the present day, Japan has consistently invested in innovative projects and infrastructure to support high-speed access for its population [1]. This focus on progress has resulted in:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Extensive Fiber-Optic Networks</strong><br>Japan was among the first countries to embrace fiber-optic technology, giving a significant portion of its population access to high-speed broadband [3].</li>\n  <li><strong>Pioneering Mobile Internet</strong><br>With the rapid proliferation of mobile phones, especially in the 2000s, Japan championed mobile Internet services that became integral to daily life[1][3]. Arguably the most revolutionary one was i-mode, launched by NTT DoCoMo in 1999. i-mode offered a range of mobile-relevant services—email, news, games, and even early forms of e-commerce—over a simplified interface for the small screens of the phones then available. Its user-friendliness and complete service laid the groundwork for how people would interact with the web on the go, prompting mobile internet adoption around the world. As a result, i-mode became the pivotal point in propelling Japan as a global innovator in the field of mobiles.</li>\n  <li><strong>Advanced Internet Services &amp; Applications</strong><br>Many cutting-edge solutions—such as digital payment platforms and innovative data-sharing systems—originated in Japan, reflecting the country’s commitment to leveraging the Internet for social and economic benefits [2].</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By the late 1990s, Japan had secured a leading global position in terms of Internet penetration and technological sophistication, setting a high standard for connectivity and user experience [1].</p>"
